\section*{Abstract}

Distributed application management system is important for
managing applications on distributed computing platforms. 
% The management system is designed in distributed approach
% and also need to be well monitored and maintained
% throughout its lifecycle. Currently, distributed
% management systems are monitored and maintained using
% centralized approach, which is not scalable and efficient.
One of the main caveat of using a distributed management
system is that the management system itself, as a
distributed application, need to be deployed and maintained
continually.  In this papar, we propose Self-Managed Overlay
Network (SMOM) and explore the challenges associated with
designing a management system with self-management
capability. SMON manages itself using epidemic approach at
runtime. SMON can automatically deploys itself to a set of
machines and recovers failed peers \emph{securely}. It can
also upgrade itself to new versions online. Through
mathematical analysis and evaluation on PlanetLab platform,
we show that SMON achieves good performance and scalability.
