dependency line cannot be draw from log

we can overlay the task model on scapel to a) see how high
level tasks are mapped to low level synchronization
operations, b) see dependency among tasks

Or we can put a short discussion paragraph at the end of
each subsection of Design section.

By leveraging system log, our task model is different with
our previous work~\cite{Haohui2008} in several ways.  By taking more
heuristics from logs, the task model contains semantic on
higher level tasks, for example session.  This can be hardly
expressed in scalpel's task model.  Second, we use
value-based join to catch dependencies among tasks, which
requires experts knowledge. While scalple uses
synchronization points to infer low level dependencies.

We recognize the complementary between the two approaches.
It will be better to combine them together and see how high
level task and dependencies are mapped to that at low level.
