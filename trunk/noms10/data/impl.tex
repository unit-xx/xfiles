\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

We implement the prototype of SMON system in Python, and the
final installation package size of a BON peer is about
122KB, with 1000+ lines of code.

\caption{RPC interfaces implemented by SMON peer and authentication
agent}
\label{fig:rpc}
\end{table*}

The maintenance tasks of a SMON peer is implemented in
several threads, including one for monitoring and
maintaining other peers, one for updating membership list,
one for update \texttt{livetag}. For each application, a
separate thread will be started for maintaining the
application.

The communication of SMON peers and agents are implemented
as RPCs, and they are summarized in table~\ref{fig:rpc}.

SMON peer spawns a ssh/scp process to deploy on remote
machines. A modified \texttt{ssh-agent} is started which
forwards the authentication challenge from ssh/scp to the
remote authenticate agent. The agent only implements one RPC
interface \texttt{resolve\_challenge} described in
table~\ref{fig:rpc}.

The configuration parameters used at SMON runtime is stored
in a configuration file. It stores the time intervals among
consecutive maintenance tasks, the version numbers for SMON
peer and membership list, the $<$livetag, version$>$ tuple,
the address of authentication agent. The configuration file
is implemented as a SQLite database file to avoid data loss
at machine crash. The membership list is stored separately
in compressed format.

%SMON makes a predefined and consistent directory layout of
%peer installation and it is critical for peers to perform
%their functions correctly. A SMON peer is installed to
%\texttt{SMON} directory of user's home directory, and this
%setting can be changed. Under \texttt{bin} directory, a
%\texttt{run.py} and \texttt{smon.cfg} is placed. To start
%SMON peer, \texttt{run.py} is executed and it read
%configuration in \texttt{smon.cfg} and start the version
%specified in \texttt{smon.cfg}. A new version SMON peer
%should change \texttt{smon.cfg} appropriately. Different
%version of SMON peer is placed according to version number
%under different directories. \texttt{app} directory contains
%different application entries, as different directories. A
%configuration file for each application is placed under it
%directory. Installation package of SMON peer and
%applications are stored under \texttt{packages} directory,
%placed according to its name and version.
