Generally, SMON is defined as a distributed system with
built-in self-management capability, namely, self-deploy,
self-recover and self-update. It consists of peers on every
machine where applications will be deployed and managed by
SMON. The peers are all identical in functionality. They
communicate with each other epidemically to detect and
recover failed peers. A failed peer ... So, for a failed
peer, deployed first, if necessary, and be started. In this
way, even there is only one peer, the whole SMON will be
deployed and running on all the machines ... While SMON is
running, the failed process will... SMON peer has an
associated version number and it is stored persistently with
each peer. The version number is used to update SMON
``online'' to newer version. When two peer communicate ...
Two peers work cooperately to update the lower version to
the latest verison. Using epidemic communication, this
mechanism will ensure the whole SMON system will be updated
once a single peer is updated.
