\section*{Abstract}

Distributed application management system is important for
managing applications on distributed environments. The
management system is designed in distributed approach and
also need to be well monitored and maintained throughout its
lifecycle. Currently, distributed management systems are
monitored and maintained using centralized approach, which
is not scalable and efficient.

We propose SMON (Self-Managed Overlay Network) in this
paper. SMON is a distributed system with built-in
self-management capability. It manages itself using epidemic
approach at runtime. SMON can automatically deploys itself
on a set of machines and recovers failed peers securely. It
can also upgrade itself to new versions online. SMON can
manage a set of distributed applications. By deploying other
management system on top of SMON, its management capability
can be extended greatly.
