两个问题：

1. smon能解决的问题说得太小

a. 针对tool说

challenges:

a. scalable and runs reliably with little human intervention
b. secure
c. reasonable application management semantic


2. smon如何工作说的黏糊，不畅快

SMON is a distributed application management system with
built-in self-management capability. It consists of peers on a
set of machines where applications will be deployed and running.
Peers of SMON monitor and maintain each other. They will
automatically deploy new peers on fresh machines, or recover
failed peers. SMON peers exchange their associated version
numbers and upgrade themselves to latest version. 


SMON deploys and maintains itself using epidemic algorithm.

(can be used at address challenge part)
SMON works by maintaining several global states consistently by
all the peers using epidemic algorithm. For example, . A peer
performs several maintainence tasks each of which maintains a
dedicated state.
