\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we describe SMON, a management system with
self-management capability. By using epidemic algorithm and
authentication agent, SMON can monitors and maintains itself
automatically and securely on a set of distributed machines.
Through mathematical analysis and evaluation, it is shown
that SMON achieves good performance and scalability.
