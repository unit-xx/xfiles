self-management is implemented upon epidemic algorithm.

self-management is implemented by several activities? task?

self-management is implemented by SMON peers as several threads,
each maintains a specific state of 

self-management capacity is achieved by making peers monitoring
and maintaining each other.

epidemic monitoring among peers

self-management functionality

exchange \texttt{$<$livetag, version$>$} tuples epidemically

peers exchanges their version numbers epidemically


self-management capacity can be disabled so that SMON can be
stopped from running. SMON uses a boolean variable to control
enable and disable of itself, the variable is maintained
distributedly among peers using epidemic algorithm.
